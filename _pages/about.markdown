# About Me

I'm Anton, a passionate software engineer currently working at Snowflake in San Mateo, CA.

## Professional Experience

At Snowflake, I'm involved in crafting robust backend solutions for our database product. My focus lies in ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency, key aspects that drive modern database technologies. I enjoy tackling complex problems and am always eager to explore new technologies and methodologies to enhance our services. 

## Education

I hold a Master of Science in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of California, San Diego.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, I cherish my life in Foster City, enjoying the unique blend of cultures and experiences that California offers. While I'm quite adept at navigating complex software challenges, I'm currently embracing a different kind of challenge: learning how to snowboard. Though I'm just a beginner, I find joy and excitement in this new adventure.
